			<p> As the French philospher Jean-Paul Sarte so poignantly put in <strong>"Hell is other people."</strong> While I no longer agree with this sentiment, I can emphatize with the guy. When I was about four or five, my parents threw me a birthday party. There was a cake, presents and a pinata (of some sort). When the time came, I lined up, got blindfolded, spun around in circles, and whacked the papier-mache star with a mallet, just like the other kids. Hitting something with a stick wa very gratifying, but I had never seen a pinata before, and no idea that there was any sort of end goal. Therefore, it came as a complete shock to me; I stood frozen. I was completely unaware that such a treasure even existed in that poor pinata, so instead of jumping for joy to fight for my undivided rights, I turned, ran straight to the nearest table and promptly crawled under it. Twenty-two years later, I'm still not a huge fan of surprises.</p>
